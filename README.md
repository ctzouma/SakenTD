## How to play
A basic outline of the game is as follows:
* To start pick a stage (currently there are only 2 stages)
* You will enter the stage. At this point you have some starting gold to build Towers to defend your base
* Click the hammer icon to build Towers.
* Once a Tower is selected, click within the highlighted region of the map to build it there.
* The game gives some time before a wave of enemies come, which you must kill, to prepare
* Kill enemies to gain gold
* Use gold to upgrade towers
* Survive 10 waves to clear the stage, and gain special coins that you can use in the shop.
* Wave 7 has special enemies that drop "Crystals". You can use these to upgrade your Towers into speciality towers with elements.
* The shop is accessible on the stage select screen, where you can buy element upgrades for Towers.
* Element upgrades add skills and effects to your Towers, so try them out!
* Example skills include: stunning an enemy for a few moments (they are unable to move forward)
* If enemies reach the destination at the end of their path, you lose lives. Lose all your lives and you fail the stage.

### Tips
  * Each round, you gain a percentage of your current gold as additional income. To spend or not to spend?
  * The special rounds on Wave 7 do not deduct lives. They just give bonuses.
